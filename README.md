Hi! This is my first time making a website with HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.
This is a website that helps people who want to learn French practice it by reading stories and articles.
I want it to be 5 to 8 pages because it's just a little project for my university assignment :).
The source code and ressorces are in the "Wafa Selmi Website" folder!
